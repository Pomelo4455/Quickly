# Quickly!

Quickly! is a simple, fast, and free tool that summarizes the content of websites using scraping and AI technologies. It allows users to quickly get an overview of the main points of a webpage, without having to read (or even enter) the website.

## Features

- Summarizes the content of a webpage using AI
- Provides an overview of the main points of the webpage

## Getting Started

To use Quickly!, you need to have Node.js and NPM installed on your computer. You can download them from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Once you have Node.js and NPM installed, you can clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/quickly.git

You can then open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to use the application.
